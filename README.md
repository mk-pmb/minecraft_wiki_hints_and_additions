Minecraft Wiki Hints and Additions
==================================

<!--#echo json="package.json" key="description" -->
Stuff I want my browser to reminded me about when reading the Minecraft Wiki.
(I can&#39;t contribute there because their registration form is broken.)

Spoiler: If the "Register" button in Minecraft wiki's registration form
is disabled (unclickable), it means ReCaptcha hates you. No challenge was
displayed, nor any button to even try and solve a challenge. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Known issues
------------

* The Fandom.com wikis should be more semantic. It's nice that some tables
  have a `<caption>`, but would be even nicer if that would also generate an
  anchor. And all their short anchors (meant for users) should additionally
  have have one for pro users that includes the heading name of their chapter.
  I guess I'll have to write a proxy for that some time, so I can use proper
  Web Annotations.
